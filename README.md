# AstroCalculator

This is an Astro Calculator which can calculator your weight on a selected planet 🪐. For the ones who do not believe that Pluto is a planet you may have it taken out of the list by selecting the checkbox. Additionally, if you happen to discover a new planet 🔭, please add it to the list. The planet's name and weight multiplier is needed in order to have it part of the list.
